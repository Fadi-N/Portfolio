                This innovative project streamlines business information retrieval through two search forms,
                accommodating searches based on NIP or REGON.

                The user-friendly application demands the input of a
                specific date for each search, ensuring precise results. Upon form completion and submission, the
                Ministry of Finance API transforms JSON data into valuable insights, presenting details such as business
                name, location, and other relevant specifics.
