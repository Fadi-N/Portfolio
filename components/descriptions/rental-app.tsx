                With a focus on user authentication, I integrated NextAuth.js for seamless login, signup, and OAuth
                (Google and GitHub).

                Elevating user experience, I employed react-hot-toast for intuitive notifications
                and error handling. The app boasts Next.js 13 routing, ensuring smooth navigation. Users can personalize
                their experience through filtered listings based on preferences, backed by middleware for authentication
                checks and data validation. Route Handlers (POST, GET, DELETE) facilitate efficient data management.

                Experience the convenience of reservation and trip functionalities, enabling users to effortlessly book,
                cancel, and view their trips. Additionally, a "Favorites" feature allows users to curate a collection of
                preferred listings.

                This project exemplifies my commitment to creating robust, user-friendly
                applications.
